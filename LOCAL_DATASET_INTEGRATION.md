```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Smart Integration Logic**

### **âœ… Data Matching Algorithm**:
```typescript
1. CROP MATCHING:
   - Exact matches: "Maize" â†’ "Maize (corn)"
   - Partial matches: "groundnut" â†’ "Groundnut (peanut)" 
   - Synonym recognition: "corn" â†’ "Maize (corn)"

2. SOIL TYPE FILTERING:
   - Sandy soils â†’ "Sandy / sandy loam (upland)"
   - Loamy soils â†’ Compatible matching
   - Mixed soils â†’ Best available match

3. REGIONAL CONTEXT:
   - Jharkhand locations â†’ Prioritize local dataset
   - Other regions â†’ Use AI with local cross-reference
   - Multi-state â†’ Blend approaches

4. CONFIDENCE SCORING:
   - Local data match: 95-100% confidence
   - Economic data available: +3% confidence  
   - Pest data available: +2% confidence
   - AI fallback: 85-90% confidence
```

### **âœ… Enhanced Supplier Integration**:
```typescript
// Automatic local supplier addition:
if (localEconomic.length > 0 && localEconomic[0].primaryDistricts) {
  suppliers.push({
    name: "Local Agricultural Centers (Ranchi, Latehar, Gumla)",
    url: "https://jharkhand.gov.in/agriculture"
  });
