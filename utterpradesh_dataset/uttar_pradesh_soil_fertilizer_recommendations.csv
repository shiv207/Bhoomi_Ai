Alluvial,"Nitrogen (Urea), Phosphorus (DAP), Potassium (MOP), Micronutrients (Zinc Sulphate)",Balanced NPK application; split nitrogen doses; zinc often deficient.
Alluvial / Irrigated plains,"Nitrogen (Urea), Phosphorus (DAP), Potassium (MOP), Micronutrients (Zinc, Boron)",Follow soil testing; irrigation ensures better nutrient use efficiency.
Black (Regur) / Bundelkhand edges,"Nitrogen (Urea), Phosphorus (Single Super Phosphate), Sulphur, Micronutrients (Zinc, Boron)",High clay content; maintain proper moisture to avoid nutrient lock; sulphur often needed.
Tarai / Alluvial fringe (north),"Nitrogen (Urea), Phosphorus (DAP), Potassium (MOP), Micronutrients (Zinc, Boron)",High organic matter; regular soil testing for micronutrients advisable.
Red & Yellow,"Farm Yard Manure (FYM), Nitrogen (Urea), Phosphorus (DAP), Lime (for pH correction), Micronutrients (Boron, Zinc)",Generally acidic; apply lime as per soil test; organic matter crucial to improve fertility.
