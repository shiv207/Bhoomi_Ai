# Bhoomi_AI üå±

Because the soil has secrets ‚Äî we just convinced it to spill the beans.

## Overview
Bhoomi_AI is a data-first project focused on Indian agriculture. It collects real soil analysis reports and crop recommendation data so you (or your future AI overlord) can learn what to grow, where to grow it, and why your plants have been judging your watering schedule.

At the moment, this repository is a clean, versioned home for:
- District-level soil analysis PDFs for Jharkhand.
- A crop recommendation dataset for Karnataka.

The goal is to enable rapid experimentation for agronomy-flavored ML, analytics, and decision support tools. Models and notebooks will join the party soon ‚Äî for now, we laid the red carpet.

## What‚Äôs inside
- `Jharkhand dataset/`
  - Soil analysis reports (PDF) by district: pH, nutrients, and other details that plants care about more than we do.
- `Karnataka dataset/`
  - `Crop_recommendation.csv`: tabular data suitable for ML experiments.

## Quick start
Clone the repo and start poking around:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shiv207/Bhoomi_Ai.git
cd Bhoomi_Ai
```

If you use Python, here's a tiny snack using pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Explore the crop recommendation data
path = "Karnataka dataset/Crop_recommendation.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(path)
print(df.head())
print("Rows:", len(df))
print("Columns:", list(df.columns))
```

Reading PDFs? Bring your favorite parser. For simple skimming, your OS preview works great. For NLP adventures, consider `pdfplumber`, `PyMuPDF` (fitz), or `pdftotext`.

## Why this repo exists
- Make real-world agri data easy to find and use.
- Encourage reproducible workflows (notebooks, scripts coming soon).
- Provide a foundation for crop recommendation, soil health analytics, and region-specific insights.

## Ideas you can try next
- Train a quick baseline classifier/regressor on the Karnataka dataset.
- Parse PDFs from Jharkhand and build district-wise nutrient maps.
- Build a Streamlit dashboard that says: ‚ÄúGrow X here, and here‚Äôs why.‚Äù
- Feature engineering bingo: weather, soil type, irrigation, and farmer wisdom‚Ñ¢.

## Roadmap (a.k.a. Planting schedule)
- Notebooks for EDA and baseline models.
- Model cards describing assumptions and trade-offs.
- Lightweight API for recommendations.
- Optional: GIS layers because maps make everything cooler.

## Data notes
- The PDF reports are district-level summaries. Treat them as macro indicators.
- The CSV is ready-to-use. Watch for class balance and unit consistency.
- If your plants start giving TED talks, you probably overfit.

## Repo hygiene
- We keep binaries light and version control friendly.
- `.gitignore` is set up to ignore OS junk, virtual envs, and node modules.

## Contributing
PRs are welcome! Whether it‚Äôs fixing a typo, adding a notebook, or making the README 1% funnier, we appreciate it.

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch
3. Commit with clear messages
4. Open a PR with context and screenshots (if relevant)

## License
TBD. If you plan to use this in production or research, open an issue so we can prioritize adding a proper license.

## Acknowledgements
- Farmers, scientists, and anyone who‚Äôs ever stuck a pH strip into mud.
- You, for being here. Go grow something amazing.
